# leetcode

Accepted solutions to an assortment of [leetcode](http://leetcode.com) questions completed while preparing for technical interviews.

Solutions were initially dumped into `leetcode.py` and `leetcode.go`. Eventually these files became too large. `partitioner.go` was written to split the questions into their own files.

To run the partitioner:

`$ go run partitioner.go`

Partitioned questions will be populated in the python and golang directories. URLs to the relevant leetcode questions are inserted as well.
